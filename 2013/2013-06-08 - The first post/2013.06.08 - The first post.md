# The first post

I consider myself a software developer.
I like to get things done but I'm most productive when I'm having fun as well.
That's why from time to time I come up with solutions that at a first sight, seem like an overengineering.
Of course they fit perfectly to the problem but it takes time to understand why.
Usually I'm discussing them inside my team if they are specific to a given project or posting something on stackoverflow.
However, the there is hardly any record of that.
This blog will solve this problem.
It will act as a single place where I'll be publishing why I think that a given solution is not overengineering.

Hence the name.

I hope you find it both entertaining and useful!
